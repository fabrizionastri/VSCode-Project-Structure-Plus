## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] - 2023-10-03

### Added

- Option to change the configuration/output folder
- Additional command apply filter to the output file

## [0.0.3] - 2023-03-24

### Added

- Added support for .project_structure_ignore file for user-defined ignore patterns.
- Integrated with .gitignore file when useGitIgnore setting is enabled.

### Examples

Create a .project_structure_ignore file in your project root to define custom ignore patterns. The file should contain one pattern per line. For example:

```
bash
node_modules
dist
*.log
```

This will ignore the node_modules and dist directories, and any files with the .log extension.

To enable the useGitIgnore setting, open your Visual Studio Code settings (File > Preferences > Settings), and search for "Project Structure". Enable the "Use Git Ignore" checkbox to automatically integrate the patterns defined in your .gitignore file.
